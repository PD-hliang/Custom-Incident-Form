# Custom-Incident-Form

Create a customised form in each incident to perform custom actions per incident in pagerduty e.g. update external tools with custom fields

# Notes
This is just a template to get started with and does nothing when you click on resolve besides a check on whether the fields are empty or not. 

# Installation

* Download/copy/pull this HTML file 
* Customise the template
* Host the HTML page with your prefered provider (e.g I use Amazon S3 to host this page) 
* Create a new Add-on extension in pagerDuty with the URL with where you host the page as shown below and attach to pagerduty services
