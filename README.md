# Custom-Incident-Form

Custom Incident Form will give you the ability to create a form in each incident to perform custom actions e.g. update and external tool with custom fields

This is just a template to get started with and does nothing when you click on resolve besides checking whether the fields are empty or not. 

# Installation

* Download/copy/pull this HTML file 
* Customise the template
* Host the HTML page with your prefered provider (e.g I use Amazon S3 to host this page) 
* Create a new Add-on extension in pagerDuty with the URL with where you host the page as shown below and attach to pagerduty services
